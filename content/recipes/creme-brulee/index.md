ingredients:
- 6 egg yolks
- 2 cups whipping cream
- 1/3 cup granulated sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla
- boiling water
- 8 teaspoons granulated sugar

directions:
- Heat oven to 350Â°F. In 13x9-inch pan, place 4 (6-oz) ceramic ramekins. In
  small bowl, slightly beat egg yolks with wire whisk. In large bowl, stir
  whipping cream, 1/3 cup granulated sugar and the vanilla until well mixed.
  Add egg yolks; beat with wire whisk until evenly colored and well blended.
  Pour cream mixture evenly into ramekins.
- Carefully place pan with ramekins in oven. Pour enough boiling water into
  pan, being careful not to splash water into ramekins, until water covers
  two-thirds of the height of the ramekins
- Bake 30 to 40 minutes or until top is light golden brown and sides are set
  (centers will be jiggly)
- Using tongs or grasping tops of ramekins with pot holder, carefully transfer
  ramekins to cooling rack. Cool to room temperature, about 2 hours. Cover
  tightly with plastic wrap; refrigerate until chilled, at least 4 hours but no
  longer than 48 hours
- Uncover ramekins; gently blot any liquid from tops of custards with paper
  towel. Sprinkle 2 teaspoons granulated sugar over each chilled custard.
  Holding kitchen torch 3 to 4 inches from custard, caramelize sugar on each
  custard by heating with torch about 2 minutes, moving flame continuously over
  sugar in circular motion, until sugar is melted and light golden brown. (To
  caramelize sugar in the broiler, see Broiler Directions below.) Serve
  immediately, or refrigerate up to 8 hours before serving
